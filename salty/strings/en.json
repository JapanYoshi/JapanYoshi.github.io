  , "Player 3: U I O J K L"
  , "Player 4: 7 8 9 4 5 6 (Numpad)"
  , "For convenience, we will be calling those [[↖]], [[↑]], [[↗]], [[←]], [[↓]], and [[→]], respectively."
  , "* Controller"
  , "Each player uses 4 face buttons [[↑]] [[←]] [[→]] [[↓]] and 2 shoulder buttons [[↖]] [[↗]]. In addition, each player has one joystick for typing, and each controller has a pause button."
  , "* Shared Controller"
  , "You can share some controllers among 2 people! Player 1 takes the left stick, D-pad, and two left shoulder buttons. Player 2 takes the right stick, face buttons, and two right shoulder buttons."
  , "# Basics"
  , "Answer the questions correctly using your controller."
  , "# Lifesavers"
  , "All players start with one Lifesaver. If you use the Lifesaver on a question before time runs out, one answer will be eliminated for you (two if you're lucky!), and you will get to answer after that, reducing your options to three instead of four!"
  , "# Question Types"
  , "* Standard and Candy Trivia"
  , "Use your [[↑]], [[←]], [[→]], and [[↓]] keys to select one of four options."
  , "Each correct answer nets you 10 points, but each wrong answer costs you 10 points."
  , "In Candy Trivia with Salty Barr, the question and/or options are about candy."
  , "* Sorting Time"
  , "Use your [[←]] and [[→]] keys to sort the 7 items into 2 categories. Sometimes you need to press [[↑]] to sort into both. If you are unsure and don't want to risk it, you can press [[↓]] to skip, you chicken."
  , "Each item is worth 3 points."
  , "* The 1000x Question"
  , "The question starts out at 10000 points! Answer as soon as possible, because only the first to answer correctly gets the points, and the question's value lowers every instant. But don't jump the gun! You are not allowed to answer before the options are revealed."
  , "* All Outta Salt"
  , "You will see a phrase whose every syllable rhymes with the syllables of another phrase. When you know what it is, press any face button to buzz in, then type in your answer. If nobody answers for a certain amount of time, up to 3 hints will be shown."
  , "Each All Outta Salt is worth 20 points, but each hint will lower the value by 5 points."
  , "You cannot use a Lifesaver on All Outta Salt."
  , "* Sugar Rush"
  , "You will get a title, followed by 6 categories containing 6 items. For each category, press the corresponding key ([[↖]], [[↑]], [[↗]], [[←]], [[↓]], [[→]]) to answer whether that item fits that category. Categorize an item correctly and gain points; Categorize an item incorrectly and lose points."
  , "Each item is worth 2 points, making the whole Sugar Rush valued at 72 points."
  , "You cannot use a Lifesaver on Sugar Rush."
  , "* Hike Your Likes"
  , "You will get 3 items and 5 categories. For each category, press the corresponding key ([[↑]], [[←]], [[↓]], [[→]]) to answer whether that item fits that category. Each correct answer gives the player 100 'likes', which are then converted to points at the end of the game. There is also a 4th bonus item for each category, which, in multiplayer mode, can only be answered by the half of players with the fewest 'likes'."
  , "10 likes is equal to 1 point, and you break even at 1000 likes."
  , "You cannot use a Lifesaver on Hike Your Likes."
