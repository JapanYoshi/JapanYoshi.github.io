      <h3>My “First Impression” Video Review</h3>
      <p>This is the review I made early on when I got the controller. I’ve since used it for months, so I have additional insight, which I will share in this article. That being said, you can entirely skip this video and start reading, and still get the gist.</p>

      <h3>What’s the 8BitDo&reg; Lite?</h3>
      <p>The 8BitDo Lite is a teeny tiny controller for the Nintendo Switch&reg; and PC. Think a Nintendo Wii&reg; Classic
        Controller but smaller: It’s about as tall and wide as an iPhone&reg; 5, but a bit over twice as thick, and lighter
        by one third.</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li><strong>8BitDo Lite</strong>120 × 66.2 × 16.2&nbsp;mm, 84&nbsp;g</li>
        <li><strong>iPhone 5</strong>123.88 × 58.6 × 7.6&nbsp;mm, 112&nbsp;g</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Its small size and lack of protruding analog sticks makes this controller astoundingly portable. You could even fit it in your back pocket like a phone if you wanted to!</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Compatibility</h4>
      <p>It natively supports both Nintendo Switch and PC. There is a toggle between the <kbd class="button">&minus;</kbd> and <kbd class="button">+</kbd> buttons, which toggles the behavior between the Switch and X-input standards.</p>
      <p>It also works as a wired controller!</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li><strong>Switch mode</strong>Flip the switch to S. Press the Pair button to connect to a new Switch, or just
          press a button to connect to the Switch you last connected.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth&reg; mode (PC, Xbox One, and Android)</strong>Flip the switch to X. Press the Pair button to connect to a
          new device, or just press a button to connect to the device you last connected.</li>
        <li><strong>Wired mode (PC and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">OTG</a> compliant
            Android)</strong>Flip the switch to X. Take the included charge cable. Plug the narrow end to the
          controller. Plug the wide end to the computer.</li>

      <h3>D-pads, Meet the D-pads...</h3>
      <p>One of the main defining features of the 8BitDo Lite is that it has 2 D-pads. They map to the analog sticks.</p>
      <h4 id="swap">Undocumented Swap Trick!</h4>
      <p>By holding <kbd class="button">&minus;</kbd> and <kbd class="button" aria-label="direction left">&blacktriangleleft;</kbd> for 3 seconds, you can <strong>swap the left D-pad and the direction buttons!</strong> So, for example, in <em>Tetris&reg; 99,</em> you can use the D-pad to move pieces, while use the direction buttons to change your targeting strategy.</p>
      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="https://thirdpersonblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/tetris-99-controls.png"/>
        <span>Or you can switch them in the controls, but not all games give you that luxury.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="nope">
      <h3>What the Lite <em>Can’t</em> Do for You</h3>
      <p>Its characteristic hardware makes the controller incompatible or hard to use with certain types of games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/8bitdo-lite-controller-review">Nic Vargus from IGN</a> slammed the controller because of this reason. If you, hypothetical Switch owner, want a second player controller for these games, the 8BitDo Lite is <strong>NOT</strong> for you.</p>
      <h4>Precise Stick Inputs</h4>
      <p>Because these D-pads only give digital output&mdash;that is, they’re either at full tilt or no tilt&mdash;they are <em>definitely not</em> for games that require precise input from control sticks, like <em>Splatoon&reg;</em> or <em>Overwatch&reg;</em>. I’ve tried playing <em>Biped</em> using this controller, and while it <em>works</em>, it didn’t <em>work</em> work.</p>
      <h4>Stick Presses</h4>
      <p>In addition, it is very hard to press down the control sticks; you need to press all 4 directions on the D-pads to register a stick press. So if your game requires stick presses, leave the 8BitDo Lite out of it.</p>
      <h4>Motion Controls</h4>
      <p>The 8BitDo Lite doesn’t have the budget for an accelerometer and gyroscope, so things like aiming in <em>Doom</em> or some actions in <em>Super Mario Odyssey&reg;</em> are out of the question.</p>
      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="8bdl-odyssey.png"/>
        <span>No, I don’t think I will. (Just press <kbd class="button">Y</kbd> to normally throw Cappy.)</span>
      </div>
      <h4>Analog Triggers</h4>
      <p>Okay, so the Switch doesn’t have analog triggers to start with, which is no problem for Switch gamers. But because this controller can be used as an Xbox controller, I thought it would merit a mention that Switch controllers don’t have analog triggers to start with. That means games like <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> won’t have sensitive pedal pushing.</p>
      <h4>Rumble</h4>
      <p>Maybe “need” is too strong of a word. Regardless, the 8BitDo Lite doesn’t have a rumble pack. HD Rumble&reg;? Fuh-<em>ged</em>daboutit!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="yes">
      <h3>What the Lite Excels At</h3>
      <p>Despite the above restrictions, a lot of the games I play are actually great fits for the 8BitDo Lite, not despite, but because, of the D-pad sticks. If you, hypothetical Switch owner, want a second player controller for these games, the 8BitDo Lite is for you!</p>
      <h4>Action Games (Especially Retro Ones)</h4>
      <p>I’ve tried <em>Sonic&trade; Mania</em> on PC, and it worked really well. The D-pads on this controller are a joy to use, which lives up to the reputation of 8BitDo making really good D-pads. (Though, if you prefer membrane D-pads over clicky D-pads, stick to the SN30 or SN30 Pro.)</p>
      <p>And because you can switch the functionality of the direction buttons and the left D-pad <a href="#swap">(read up for how)</a>, you can even use it for games that expect you to use the D-pad instead of the analog stick! It makes the NES and SNES games on Nintendo Switch Online joyous to play.</p>
      <p>I’ve also played <em>Rocket League</em> using the controller, and had a great time with it, though that might just be because I’m not good enough at the game to appreciate the importance of subtle stick inputs.</p>
      <h4>Menu-Heavy Games (e.g. RPGs, Trivia Games...)</h4>
      <p>The Lite also pairs well with turn-based RPGs like the <em>Dragon Quest</em> series. Menu navigations are much less painful, especially compared to the atrocious D-pad that the Pro Controller has.</p>
      <p>If you want to play the Switch adaptations of, for example, <em>Monopoly</em>, <em>Jeopardy</em>, or <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>, this controller makes them a breeze to navigate; menus are great with the Lite, and these games are pretty much all menus!</p>
      <h4>Puzzle Games</h4>
      <p>Puzzle games like <em>Tetris 99</em> or <em>Puyo Puyo&reg;</em> absolutely shine with this controller, because of the precision that the clicky, responsive D-pads give you. No longer are you cursed by the ambiguous squishiness and wrong inputs caused by inferior D-pads (or worse, having to use the stick on a sideways Joy-Con).</p>
      <h4>Rhythm Games</h4>
      <p>If a rhythm game works okay with a controller, it works stellarly with the 8BitDo Lite, because of the clicky, responsive, and tactile buttons.</p>
      <p>I play <em>Stepmania</em> with the 8BitDo Lite, mapping both D-pads to the 4 panels, corresponding the left one to my left foot, and the right one to my right foot. As far as pad charts go, this is ideal, and gives me a quasi-arcade experience without moving my feet.</p>
      <div class="imgBox">
        <img src="./8bdl-sm.gif"/>
        <span>Watch my thumbs dance!</span>
      </div>
      <h4>...Especially Those Designed for the PlayStation Stick Layout</h4>
      <p>I’ve also tried another rhythm game, <em>DJMax Respect</em>, and the 8BitDo Lite is great for it. The “side track” notes are only mappable to the analog sticks, which would make the game feel asymmetrical on an Xbox layout controller. However, the Lite lets you <a href="#swap">switch the direction buttons with the left D-pad</a>, so you can get a comfy button position without changing the settings!</p>
      <p>You could expect similar results when playing <em>Superbeat Xonic</em> on the Switch!</p>
      <h4>Fighting Games</h4>
      <p>Okay, this controller is <em>not</em> better than a fightstick for most fighting games. It only has 4 face buttons after all!</p>
      <p>But for most fighting games, where you only need digital inputs from the joystick, the 8BitDo Lite is a godsend. I’ve used the official <em>Pokkén</em> controller before, and I still felt like the 8BitDo Lite had the better D-pad!</p>
      <h4>Anything If You Have Joy-Con Drift</h4>
      <p>These sticks are too D-paddy to drift.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="conclusion">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The 8BitDo Lite is not for everybody, and definitely not for people who play first person shooters. But 8BitDo as a company doesn’t target those people. 8BitDo found its niche, and knows its niche well.</p>
      <p>I wholeheartedly recommend the 8BitDo Lite for anyone who plays <a href="#yes">the kinds of games I recommend</a>, whether on the PC or on the Nintendo Switch. And with a 25USD retail price (generally), it’s an appealing impulse buy that you won’t regret!</p>
